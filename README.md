====================

Highlight Navigation is a plugin that enables keyboard and mouse navigation and highlighting for items belonging to elements. For example, this plugin is good for highlighting table rows when you press the down key or click on the row, as well as applying actions upon pressing the “enter” key (or any other key, configurable in the options) or clicking on a row.
